> WOW!!! If you have semantic memory tied to your UserPromptSubmit hooks, you MUST ALSO include it in your PreToolUse hook. I promise you - it will be an absolute GAME CHANGER. It will put your efficiency levels are over 9,000 (*vegeta voice*).

> The problem with relying strictly on the UserPromptSubmit hook for semantic memory injection is the workflow drift from your original prompt. The memories it injects at the initiation of your prompt will be less and less relevant to the workflow the longer the workflow is.

Claude thinks to itself, "hmm, okay I'm going to do this because of this", then starts to engage the tool of its choice, and BOOM:

> PreToolUse hook fires, takes the last 1,500 characters from the most recent thinking block from the active transcript, embeds it, pulls relevant memories from your vector database, and injects them to claude right before it starts using its tool (hooks are synchronous). This all happens in less than 500 milliseconds.
